# phold
Phage Annotations with Protein Structures

* Works only with CUDA GPU for now.

## To create the env

```
git clone "https://github.com/gbouras13/phold.git"
cd phold
pip install -e .

# need foldseek
# will add the python deps into pyproject.toml later

mamba create -n prostt5 python=3.9 foldseek pip
conda activate prostt5
pip install transformers
pip install sentencepiece

# https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
#pip install torch

# for my gridion
# need it choose the right version of torch compatible with your CUDA version

mamba install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

## Tests

Required Susie's toy_foldseek_db for now as `-d`.

```
phold run -i tests/test_data/pharokka.gbk -o test_output -t 16 -f -d toy_foldseek_db/
```

## To do

* Add `phold remote` using Milot's suggestions

```
    If you want something easy to run ProstT5 without setting it up yourself, you can use our API for now:

    https://3di.foldseek.com/predict/ASD

    Just replace "ASD" with the actual sequence. This endpoint is driving the feature in the dev foldseek server. There is some rate limiting enabled, so be prepared to handle http errors. It will also error on sequences longer than ~3k AA.
```

* Add glue code for outputs (we can discuss what to include here)
* Test different databases. Tradeoff between size, speed and sensitivity. 
* Foldseek params (discuss with martin and milot).
* Try larger databases foldseek has already? Uniprot 50? Probably not worth it? Maybe swissprot?
* Get CPU working - will need help from Milot.
